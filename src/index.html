      Are you a "leftist" whose friends and followers all just happen to be
      goose-stepping race-realist ethno-nationalist frogs?  Do you "love
      women", but just hate <em>feminism</em> because it's part of a globalist
      cultural Marxist conspiracy to ruin video games by <em>censorship</em> of
      vagina bones?  Perhaps you're a big fan of <em>science</em>&mdash;facts
      such as the genetic superiority of some races over others, the <em>two
      genders</em>, and that global warming is a hoax perpetuated by the
      Rothschilds?  Clearly your brilliant, expertly informed opinions deserve,
      nay, are <em>owed</em> a platform.  And what better place to find your
      audience than YouTube?! You've got your suit, you've got your hat, you've
      got your totally-not-<em>problem-glasses</em> eyewear.  Now all you need
      is a name for your channel:
      </p>
      <button id="generate" class="tube">Generate</button>
      <p class="centered">
      Your new YouTube channel name is:
      </p>
